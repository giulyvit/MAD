# MAD - a Model for Farm Analysis 

MAD is a multi-objective Linear Programming optimisation model written written in GAMS for working with FADN data.
Data pe-processed with SmallTalk and parameters estimated with R.

Developed from an initial draft by Claudio Signorotti, then completed by G.Vitali, debugged with the help of Guido Bazzani who rewrote the code in a final version (almost lost). This version has been rewritten by a ver 2018 (pre-Covid) from Giuliano Vitali.
